Must compile with -lm. You must hit w,a,s, or d to start the program. Use WASD to move the selected area and Q and E to soom out 
and in respectivelyYou can hit ~ to create a detail BMP file of the surrounding area. The BMP takes a while to load since I 
decided to put quite a bit of detail into it, but give it 10-20 seconds and it will close the program and create a BMP file called b.BMP 
that you can export and view (or just view on Linux).
