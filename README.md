# Mandelbrot_Set
# Joshua Jacobs
This is a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set that you can navigate using your keyboard to pan around and zoom in and out.

Must compile with -lm. You must hit w,a,s, or d to start the program. Use WASD to move the selected area and Q to zoom out 
and E to zoom in. You can hit ~ to create a detailed BMP file of the currently selected area. After 10-20 seconds and it will close the program and create a BMP file called b.BMP 
that you can export and view (or just view on Linux).
